# Getting Started With Natural Language Processing in Python

Natural-language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data (wikipedia).

This rapidly improving area of artificial intelligence covers tasks such as speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural language generation.

In the following projects, we're going to be building a strong NLP foundation by practicing:

Tokenizing - Splitting sentences and words from the body of text.

Part of Speech tagging

Chunking

This foundation will open the door for machine learning in conjunction with NLP. We will cover:

Machine learning in NLP

How to tie in Scikit-learn (sklearn) with NLTK

We are going to be using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) which is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language
